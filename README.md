### Hannelore's ReadMe

## Who the **heck** *am* I ?

##### I am 25 year old human being learning to study code with the hope of being able to learn, grow, and create. 

##### I value learning and connecting with people. I try to be a good citizen of the universe where I can and I do what I can to make the best choices that I can with the information given to me. 

##### I've been working since I was 16 and am very excited at the prospect of becoming a developer and working remotely. My big dream is to travel around the world to forested areas, find a community, and work to add trees to the forest as well as study them. Coding will give me the means to go back to school and get a degree which is something I have not had a chance to do. 

##### Other than knowing my values and life plan, some good things to know about me are: I love to ask questions, I love answering questions, and I enjoy understanding how and why people think the way that they do. 

##### most **importantly** I love: 

1. kind people
2. sleep
3. food
